#### Intro
Students come from all over the world to participate in this elective. Many of you are in Copenhagen for the fist time. During the intro the class is _storming._ We will introduce you to your lecturers, your team and familiarize you to methods and tools that you are going to learn during the semester. 
    
    

#### Google Design Sprint
The sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers. Your team will get started on protoyping a digital product for an external client. You will be training for very (extremely) short loops of learning with weekly feedback from the client. You will finalize your digital product and present the final solution in the end.  

#### Deep Dive 
It's time for you to dive deep and create your individual learning goals and develop the skills you need. Furthermore this week encourage you to encounter the real world. Intentions are fine, but nothing beats getting out of the building, challenge yourself and facing real life. 

#### The Startup Way
Taking off-set in the lean startup approach. During this theme you will be launching a new enterprise—whether it’s a tech start-up, a small business, or an initiative within a large corporation this is what you are going to do with your team. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. 

#### Agile Development
Learn how to kickstart, execute, and deliver your agile projects. Combining cutting-edge tools with classic agile practices, you will learn everything you need to deliver something of value every week and develop products in iterations.

#### Prepare for exam
Foot off the speeder. It's time to wrap up your learnings and prepare yourself for the exam. You may still have (some) time on the side to continue learning loops on your product though.

#### Exam
We will be running an intense semester - and now it is time to demonstrate how you have progressed and learned during the semester. The exam will be an indivudal oral exam based on your portfolio, worklog and an individual synopsis.

#### Workshops and labs

#### Individual reflections on learning  
You will keep a worklog and add to your prjects to your own portfolio) and you need to prioritize to spend some time thinking out of the box - what are your options from here? What are your reflection on your learnings? What are your challenges and how are you going to solve them?

#### Retrospective and Planning in teams
Each week you will conduct an internal team retrospective to discuss and maybe adjust your roles in the team and then you will need to look ahead and implement your learnings in your team. 

#### Team work: Fill in the blanks
